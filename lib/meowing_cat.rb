## code your solution here.
class Cat

  attr_accessor :name

  def meow
    puts "meow!"
  end

end


  #attr_accessor is really two macros attr_writer, and attr_reader.
  #a getter and a setter.

  #attr_accesor is the easier way of doing getters and setters all in one.
#no more...
 
  #def name=(name)
  #  @name = name
  #end
  # or 
  #def name
  #  @name
  #end
